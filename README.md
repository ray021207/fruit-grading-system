Aim of Project
    	The Fruit Grading System project aims to develop a comprehensive and efficient solution for grading fruits based on various parameters such as size, color, weight, and quality. By leveraging modern web technologies and database management systems, the system aims to streamline the fruit grading process, making it more accurate and user-friendly. This project targets fruit producers, distributors, and retailers who require a reliable method of assessing the quality of fruits for sale or distribution. Ultimately, the goal is to improve efficiency, reduce manual effort, and ensure consistency in fruit grading operations, thereby enhancing overall productivity and profitability in the fruit industry. 

Objectives of the Project
The main objectives of this system are:
1.	The system should accurately assess the quality and attributes of the fruits being graded. This includes factors such as size, color, ripeness, and external defects.
2.	Enhance accessibility and scalability of fruit grading operations through modern web technologies and database management systems.
3.	The system aims to automate the process of grading fruits, reducing the time and labor required compared to manual grading methods. This can lead to increased efficiency in fruit processing facilities.
4.	Implementing a fruit grading system can help reduce costs associated with manual labor and potential losses due to inconsistent grading.
5.	Create a user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to facilitate interaction with the system.

Scope of the Project
      	The scope of the Fruit Grading System project encompasses the development of a comprehensive software solution designed to revolutionize the fruit grading process. Utilizing frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, alongside Python Flask for backend logic and MySQL for database management, the system aims to provide a user-friendly interface for inputting data and receiving real-time feedback on fruit grading. Additionally, the integration of advanced machine learning algorithms like ResNet50 and InceptionV3 enhances grading accuracy. Ultimately, the project seeks to streamline fruit grading operations, improve efficiency, and reduce manual effort across the supply chain. disease, ultimately benefiting patients and healthcare professionals alike.

Methodology
The methodology of the Fruit Grading System project involves a multi-stage approach to develop a comprehensive software solution for grading fruits. Initially, requirements gathering and analysis are conducted to understand the needs of stakeholders and define grading criteria. Next, frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are utilized to create an intuitive user interface for interacting with the system. Python Flask is then employed as the backend framework to handle server-side logic and facilitate communication between the frontend and the underlying algorithms. Machine learning algorithms such as ResNet50 and InceptionV3 are integrated to automate the grading process based on predefined criteria. Finally, MySQL is used as the database management system to store and manage data related to fruits, grading criteria, and user information. Throughout the development process, testing and validation are conducted to ensure the system's accuracy, efficiency, and reliability.
